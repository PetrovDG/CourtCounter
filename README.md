# CourtCounter
Hello everybody!
The app is CourtCounter app with some upgrades. 
I will appreciate any advice how to solve a problem with a Chronometer: The app have a chronometer with Start, Pause and Reset buttons. I use a variable that keeps track on the time, that has passed since the Chronometer was started, and it keep tracking time even the screen is rotated. Unfortunately, when the pause button is clicked and the screen is rotated, the chronometer start counting again with the actual time passed, as never been stopped.  
Thank you for the help in advance!
